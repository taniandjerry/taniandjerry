## Hiya, I'm Tania! Or @taniandjerry 👋

> **Version**: 2.0  
> **Status**: Actively maintained by me + occasional keyboard contributions from Milk & Cheese

## 🎯 Overview

Hi! I'm a technical community manager and strategist at Block. This is my personal repo, which is my digital home on GitHub. Welcome! Make yourself comfy-cozy. 🫖

## 🤙🏽 Core Features

### Primary Functions:
- **Community**: Specializes in nurturing and growing open source communities
- **Creating fun (and hopefully funny) content**: Writes about community, tech, AI, and probably most definitely Godzilla
- **Let's get goose'd!**: Daily contributor to [goose](https://github.com/block/goose) (with help from goose itself - very meta)
- **Like a handy power cable**: Loves helping people connect with each other

### Technical Specs:
- **Pronouns**: she/her/hers
- **Power Source**: Chai (required for optimal performance)
- **Companion Units**: 
  - Cats: Milk & Cheese (after the comic book)
  - Reptiles: Chives (leopard gecko), Godzilla (crested gecko), Mashed Potato (micro gecko), Cheeto (house snake), Butter (rosy boa)

## 🚀 Quick Start Guide

### To Collaborate:
1. Say hi! I'm friendly
2. Talk about community or Godzilla (the gecko or the kaiju, both are valid tbh)
3. Share what you're working on
4. ???
5. Profit (or at least have a good conversation)
